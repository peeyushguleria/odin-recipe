    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a Punjabi household favourite. Growing up in my parents home, this
      dish was often on the menu for our much anticipated Saturday lunch. When
      Rajma Chawal was prepared at our school cafeteria the news would spread
      like wildfire and we would rush to the lunch hall with excitement. This is
      one of those dishes where you can easily say "Everybody loves Rajma
      Chawal". Think of this as North India's 'Chili sin Carne' but one where
      you won't miss the meat at all. Always served with jeera rice and
      optionally with some yoghurt and fresh onion slices.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>250g or 1.5 cup kidney beans*</li>
      <li>2 indian bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 black cardamom</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the beans overnight (or for at least 8 hours) in plenty of water.
        In a pressure cooker or heavy bottom pot add 4 cups of water, salt, bay
        leaves and a black cardamom pod. Add the soaked drained beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the beans till they are completely soft. This took 25 mins in the
        pressure cooker, will probably take around 3 hours of simmering in a
        regular pot (here's another reason to consider investing in a pressure
        cooker).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pound the ginger, garlic and green chillies into a rough paste in a
        mortar and pestle or blender. Alternately, you can also finely chop
        them. Chop the onions as finely as you possibly can and purée the
        tomatoes in a blender. Alternately, you can also use 200g of
        store-bought tomato purée.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ghee to a pan or kadhai on high heat*.* Once the ghee is hot add in
        the cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Add the asafoetida and the chopped
        onions shortly after. Once the garlic and ginger start to brown add the
        spice powders (turmeric, coriander, chilli powder and garam masala).
        Roast them for a few seconds to release their aroma but be careful not
        to burn the spices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deglaze the pan with the puréed tomatoes and add in 1 tsp of salt. Cook
        this masala into a thick reduction without a lid till all the water from
        the tomatoes has evaporated. You should be able to see the oil releasing
        from the sides. That's when you know it's ready. Once your masala has
        reduced to a thick paste, add it in the beans along with the cooking
        liquid (remove the bay leaves and cardamom).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the beans simmer on low heat together with the masala for a few
        minutes and absorb all it's flavours. Mash some of the beans with the
        back of your spoon to get a thicker consistency. Taste for seasoning and
        add more salt if necessary.
      </li>
    </ol>
