    <h1>Chicken Rice</h1>
    <img src="../images/Screenshot from 2023-08-11 21-41-21.png" alt="" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Caramelised onions, whole spices and moist chicken pieces peeping through
      fluffy basmati rice that clings to the pieces. The layers of flavours in
      this comforting dish make it so special. Indian pulaos are one pot dishes
      and something cooked as a meal in itself. My mother would also serve pulao
      at dinner parties after most guests would have finished eating Indian
      bread with the main curries. This is our family recipe and one that mum
      would make so often when we grew up. The smell of onions caramelising, the
      spices infused with rice in a big handi (steel cooking pot) and the smell
      of homemade ghee is something I will always remember. Our home was filled
      with aromas when she cooked pulao and all too often even our neighbours
      would know that she was making pulao! Mum has always taken pride in her
      cooking and more than that feeding family and friends some amazing meals.

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg chicken on the bone, skinless and cut to medium pieces</li>
      <li>250gms basmati rice</li>
      <li>525mls water or stock</li>
      <li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
      <li>1 heaped tsp cumin seeds</li>
      <li>2 large white onions thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 green chillies slit lengthwise</li>
      <li>1 heaped tsp coriander powder</li>
      <li>20gms freshly chopped coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make chicken rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender add the garlic and ginger with a splash of water and make a
        smooth paste. Set aside. In a heavy bottom sauce pan heat the oil. Add
        the whole spices letting them sizzle and infuse their flavours for 30
        seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the white onions and fry on a low heat for 30-35 mins. They will
        soften and start to colour. Make sure to stir every few minutes making
        sure it doesnâ€™t stick to the pan. The quantity of onions for this dish
        is quite a lot so give it time to fry and retain a light brown colour
      </li>
      <li>
        At this stage increase the heat to medium, add the green chillies and
        fry for a few seconds followed by the ginger and garlic paste. Fry for 2
        minutes until the raw flavours from the paste cook through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the chicken pieces along with the coriander powder stir well
        making sure the spices coat the chicken pieces sealing through for
        8-10minutes. Add salt and continue to fry the chicken
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half the water quantity and bring to a boil simmering with a lid on
        for 10 minutes. Stir half way through the cooking process. The chicken
        will nearly be done by this time
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the rice, little fresh coriander and the remaining water. Bring
        to a boil; simmer for 18-20 minutes over a low heat with a lid on until
        all the liquid has been absorbed and the chicken & rice are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat off. Leave to rest for 20 minutes to let the rice cool
        slightly before opening the lid and serving. Serve with remaining
        coriander, some lime juice, salad and raita
      </li>
    </ol>
